Gallery Virtuality
A Quake3 Engine Project

based on Quake 3:Arena source 			
by id Software

Overview						
-----------------------------				  


With the release of the Quake 3 Arena engine source code, id Software has continued it's tradition of releasing source code to their legacy games.

The sole purpose of this project is to remove weapons in the code base which others may use as a starting point for their own projects.  As such, there will be major changes other than what is essential in fixing existing bugs.  Additionally, any non-essential files have been removed from this engine/game code distribution, such as LCC, Q3ASM and Splines.  These aren't likely to see a lot of modification.

The utility source code will be maintained and distributed seperately, but will continue to be fully compatible with GTK radiant versions. The source will be changed enough to be considered an entire rewrite since weapons are highly integrated normally - taking them out makes this a streamlined game engine with the intention focused on artists using this as a tool to craft their own 3d gallery or to use directly for elaborate illustration or space design.

This code base will be updated often and will be excellent for mod makers. I will not fix whats not broke and will utilize the rendering engine to the max. Improvements will be made that will not be processor intensive. Keeping this version lightweight is important because of how much rendering will normally be done in maps and BSP files.

This package includes both source code and binarys, with the game code being DLL's.  If you desire to work with the QVM's, you can use the tools provided with the original game source code release by id Software to compile them.
