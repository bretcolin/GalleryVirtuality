          <h1>Galleryvirtuality</h1>
          <p>The GalleryVirtuality Project is the brainchild of Bret Colin Sheppard, Designer and Chief Programmer. &quot;I designed this so people in the art community would have a virtual space to show their work. It is extraordinarily expensive to rent space in &#39;actual reality&#39; to show work and in the remaining venues, many artists are turned down when they apply. This project creates a way to use virtual reality, in the control of the artist, free of cost except the cost of learning how to use this tool and time.&quot;</p>

<p>Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this
software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these
conditions:
(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this
README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice
unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files
must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of
the Independent JPEG Group".
(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.</p>

<p>These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to
acknowledge us.</p>

<p>NOTE: unfortunately the README that came with our copy of the library has
been lost, so the one from release 6b is included instead. There are a few
'glue type' modifications to the library to make it easier to use from
the engine, but otherwise the dependency can be easily cleaned up to a
better release of the library.</p>

<h1>
<a id="general-notes" class="anchor" href="#general-notes" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>GENERAL NOTES</h1>

<p>A short summary of the file layout:</p>

<p>code/                   Quake III Arena source code ( renderer, game code, OS layer etc. )
code/bspc               bot routes compiler source code
lcc/                    the retargetable C compiler ( produces assembly to be turned into qvm bytecode by q3asm )
q3asm/                  assembly to qvm bytecode compiler
q3map/                  map compiler ( .map -&gt; .bsp ) - this is the version that comes with Q3Radiant 200f
q3radiant/              Q3Radiant map editor build 200f ( common/ and libs/ are support dirs for radiant )</p>

<p>While we made sure we were still able to compile the game on Windows, GNU/Linux and Mac, this build didn't get any kind of extensive testing so it may not work completely right. Whenever an id game is released under GPL, several projects start making the source code more friendly to nowaday's compilers and environements. If you are picking up this release weeks/months/years after we uploaded it, you probably want to look around on the net for cleaned up versions of this codebase as well.</p>

<h1>
<a id="compiling-on-win32" class="anchor" href="#compiling-on-win32" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>COMPILING ON WIN32</h1>

<p>VC7 / Visual C++ 2003 project files are provided:
code/quake3.sln
q3radiant/Radiant.sln</p>

<p>To compile the qvms, you need to run some batch files:
you will need to have lcc.exe q3cpp.exe q3rcc.exe and q3asm.exe in your path
( some precompiled binaries are provided in lcc/bin and code/win32/mod-sdk-setup/bin )
the qvm batch files are in code/game code/cgame code/q3_ui code/ui ..</p>

<a id="compiling-on-gnulinux" class="anchor" href="#compiling-on-gnulinux" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>COMPILING ON GNU/LINUX</h1>

<p>the build system using cons, which may be known as scons's perl ancestor now
you don't have to track it down though, the build script is provided in the tree
you will need nasm and gcc 2.95
make sure you have the X Direct Graphics Access and X Video Mode extensions headers for your X11
a typical compile command goes like this:
[..]/code$ ./unix/cons -- gcc=gcc-2.95 g++=g++-2.95</p>

<a id="compiling-on-mac" class="anchor" href="#compiling-on-mac" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>COMPILING ON MAC</h1>

<p>project file for OSX compile is in code/macosx/Quake3.pbproj</p>
