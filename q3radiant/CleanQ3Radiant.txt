by id Software

Overview						
-----------------------------				  

With the release of the Quake 3 Arena engine source code, id Software has
continued it's tradition of releasing source code to their legacy games.

The sole purpose of this project is to compile all the known bug fixes
into one code base which others may use as a starting point for their
own projects.  As such, there will be minimal changes other than what is
essential in fixing existing bugs.  Additionally, any non-essential files
have been removed from this Radiant editor code distribution, such as CGAME, 
GAME, Q3_UI, UI and Quake3.  These are avialable through a seperate download.

This package includes both source code and binarys.  In order to get the 
compiled executable to work, you must first install the original Quake3 
Tools release, Q3ToolSetup.exe.  For unknown reasons, the build created
here works best with this version of the released tools.

Check the ToDo list and Known Bugs below for a list of planned 
features/changes and known issues.
