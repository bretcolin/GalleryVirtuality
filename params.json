{"name":"Galleryvirtuality","tagline":"The GalleryVirtuality Project is the brainchild of Bret Colin Sheppard, Designer and Chief Programmer. \"I designed this so people in the art community would have a virtual space to show their work. It is extraordinarily expensive to rent space in 'actual reality' to show work and in the remaining venues, many artists are turned down when they apply. This project creates a way to use virtual reality, in the control of the artist, free of cost except the cost of learning how to use this tool and time.\"","body":"Quake III Arena GPL source release\r\n==================================\r\n\r\nThis file contains the following sections:\r\n\r\nLICENSE\r\nGENERAL NOTES\r\nCOMPILING ON WIN32\r\nCOMPILING ON GNU/LINUX\r\nCOMPILING ON MAC\r\n\r\nLICENSE\r\n=======\r\n\r\nSee COPYING.txt for the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\r\n\r\nSome source code in this release is not covered by the GPL:\r\n\r\nIO on .zip files using portions of zlib\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nlines\tfile(s)\r\n4299\tcode/qcommon/unzip.c\r\n4546\tlibs/pak/unzip.cpp\r\nCopyright (C) 1998 Gilles Vollant\r\nzlib is Copyright (C) 1995-1998 Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler\r\n\r\n  This software is provided 'as-is', without any express or implied\r\n  warranty.

If you use our work, you ought to\r\nacknowledge us.\r\n\r\nNOTE: unfortunately the README that came with our copy of the library has\r\nbeen lost, so the one from release 6b is included instead. There are a few\r\n'glue type' modifications to the library to make it easier to use from\r\nthe engine, but otherwise the dependency can be easily cleaned up to a\r\nbetter release of the library.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL NOTES\r\n=============\r\n\r\nA short summary of the file layout:\r\n\r\ncode/\t\t\t   \t\tQuake III Arena source code ( renderer, game code, OS layer etc. )\r\ncode/bspc\t\t\t\tbot routes compiler source code\r\nlcc/\t\t\t\t\tthe retargetable C compiler ( produces assembly to be turned into qvm bytecode by q3asm )\r\nq3asm/\t\t\t\t\tassembly to qvm bytecode compiler\r\nq3map/\t\t\t\t\tmap compiler ( .map -> .bsp ) - this is the version that comes with Q3Radiant 200f\r\nq3radiant/\t\t\t\tQ3Radiant map editor build 200f ( common/ and libs/ are support dirs for radiant )\r\n\r\nWhile we made sure we were still able to compile the game on Windows, GNU/Linux and Mac, this build didn't get any kind of extensive testing so it may not work completely right. Whenever an id game is released under GPL, several projects start making the source code more friendly to nowaday's compilers and environements. If you are picking up this release weeks/months/years after we uploaded it, you probably want to look around on the net for cleaned up versions of this codebase as well.\r\n\r\nCOMPILING ON WIN32\r\n==================\r\n\r\nVC7 / Visual C++ 2003 project files are provided:\r\ncode/quake3.sln\r\nq3radiant/Radiant.sln\r\n\r\nTo compile the qvms, you need to run some batch files:\r\nyou will need to have lcc.exe q3cpp.exe q3rcc.exe and q3asm.exe in your path\r\n( some precompiled binaries are provided in lcc/bin and code/win32/mod-sdk-setup/bin )\r\nthe qvm batch files are in code/game code/cgame code/q3_ui code/ui ..\r\n\r\nCOMPILING ON GNU/LINUX\r\n==================\r\n\r\nthe build system using cons, which may be known as scons's perl ancestor now\r\nyou don't have to track it down though, the build script is provided in the tree\r\nyou will need nasm and gcc 2.95\r\nmake sure you have the X Direct Graphics Access and X Video Mode extensions headers for your X11\r\na typical compile command goes like this:\r\n[..]/code$ ./unix/cons -- gcc=gcc-2.95 g++=g++-2.95\r\n\r\nCOMPILING ON MAC\r\n================\r\n\r\nproject file for OSX compile is in code/macosx/Quake3.pbproj\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
