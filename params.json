{"name":"Galleryvirtuality","tagline":"The GalleryVirtuality Project is the brainchild of Bret Colin Sheppard, Designer and Chief Programmer. \"I designed this so people in the art community would have a virtual space to show their work. It is extraordinarily expensive to rent space in 'actual reality' to show work and in the remaining venues, many artists are turned down when they apply. This project creates a way to use virtual reality, in the control of the artist, free of cost except the cost of learning how to use this tool and time.\"","body":"Gallery Virtuality\r\nby Bret C.

As such, there will be major changes other than what is essential in fixing existing bugs.  Additionally, any non-essential files have been removed from this engine/game code distribution, such as LCC, Q3ASM and Splines.  These aren't likely to see a lot of modification.\r\n\r\nThe utility source code will be maintained and distributed seperately, but will continue to be fully compatible with GTK radiant versions. The source will be changed enough to be considered an entire rewrite since weapons are highly integrated normally - taking them out makes this a streamlined game engine with the intention focused on artists using this as a tool to craft their own 3d gallery or to use directly for elaborate illustration or space design.\r\n\r\nThis code base will be updated often and will be excellent for mod makers. I will not fix whats not broke and will utilize the rendering engine to the max. Improvements will be made that will not be processor intensive. Keeping this version lightweight is important because of how much rendering will normally be done in maps and BSP files.\r\n\r\nThis package includes both source code and binarys, with the game code being DLL's.  If you desire to work with the QVM's, you can use the tools provided with the original game source code release by id Software to compile them.\r\n\r\nCheck the ToDo list and Known Bugs below for a list of planned features/changes and known issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n-----------------------------\r\nContact Info\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\nBret C.
